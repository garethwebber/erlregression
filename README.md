# ErlRegression

This is a test of my ability to learn erlang. The plan is to build a simple web app that can pass in a series of points and get a linear regression performed.

# Journey

1. Get a working erlang build system using a simple factorial app
2. Read a file of points, one point per line, comma seperated to load
3. Perform a regression and output the details 
4. Make it work with a JSON payload and response
5. Make it a web service
6. Build a one page app to send the points and receive the response
7. For extra makes, find a client side graphing library to tie it together.
